## Abstract: 
Bird Alert! Is the tool every bird-enthusiast needs, from the casual back yard birder to the hardcore expert looking to finish a strong [Big Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_year)! 
Features:
- Set your location and other details and submit
- Back on your dashboard you will see the list of birds endemic to your current location
- Click a checkbox on an individual bird to add it to your "Watch List"
- Navigate to your `/saved` birds view to see a concise list of only the birds you're watching
- Once you have observed a bird on your list, you can remove it from your watch list from either view by un-checking the box of that bird

Upcoming features:
- In-app alerts of sightings + location data for birds on your watch list
- Accurate pictures for each bird
- Email/text alerts if you have provided an email address or phone number in your settings

## Learning Goals:
Use the technology youâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of the following:
- React
- Router
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- End to end testing with Cypress
- Create personas and user stories to describe your target audience.

Work within constraints to deliver a product for your niche audience, which helps solve a problem unique to them.

Your applications must have the following core functionality:
- Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to your audience
- Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application, such as (choose one) favoriting/unfavoriting, adding to/removing from a list, searching, commenting, etc
- Multiple views handled by Router
- Be deployed using Vercel, Heroku, Surge, or any other similar service
- PropTypes has been implemented in all components with props
